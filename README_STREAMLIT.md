    "description": "Description of your personality",
    "greeting": "Initial greeting message",
    "system_prompt": """Your specialized system prompt for this personality.
    Include specific instructions for the type of websites this personality should create."""
}

### Modifying the UI

The app uses custom CSS for styling. You can modify the styles in the `st.markdown()` section at the top of the file.

The `generate_html_with_groq()` function handles HTML generation. You can enhance it by:
- Modifying the system prompt for different styles
- Adding more specific instructions for certain website types
